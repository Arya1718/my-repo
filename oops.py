# To run this code, save it as oops.py and execute it from the command line:
# python oops.py
#
# Expected Output:
# Leo is a Lion
# Generic animal sound
# Buddy is a Golden Retriever Dog
# Woof!
# Buddy is fetching the ball!
# Generic animal sound
# Woof!
# Error initializing Animal: Name must be a string.
# Unknown is a Unknown
# Error initializing Dog: Breed must be a string.
# Unknown is a Unknown Dog
